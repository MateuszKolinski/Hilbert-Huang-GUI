# Developing graphical user interface enabling fringe pattern analysis using Hilbert-Huang transform method

## Bachelor's thesis 2020 by Mateusz Koli≈Ñski

A graphical user interface was developed, enabling fringe pattern analysis using Hilbert-Huang transform in MATLAB environment, employing AppDesigner application. To calculate output phase distribution only a single fringe pattern is required. Application implements the following steps:

1. Uploading a fringe pattern image with preliminary filtration using BM3D algorithm (Block-Matching and 3D filtering)

2. Two-dimensional empirical mode decomposition and summation of selected BIMFs

3. Calculation of fringe orientation map

4. Smoothing fringe orientation map

8. Image cropping, phase distribution surface fitting and subtraction of fitted term from the phase distribution.

The user during each step has the possibility of tailoring important parameters as well as saving every image, viewing it in a new window, changing the viewing mode, legend, color maps and tooltips. Additionally there is a possibility of saving every image from the entire application to a single file and loading them in similar fashion.

All the above steps are done in three app tabs:

1. Two-dimensional empirical mode decomposition tab
2. Hilbert spiral transform tab
3. Phase distribution surface fitting

At every step, user has the ability to save or closely inspect each and every image displayed. App also has a built-in "Auto" function, which applies all steps with default parameters. After a successful analysis, a .pdf report can be automatically generated. A user can choose and change at will at any time an image display mode (either "imagesc" or "uiimage"), style of color maps, enable tooltips and colorbars. Since some images may take longer to process, a status indicator lights up whenever calculations are in progress.
